# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 is an object storage service designed to store and retrieve
any amount of data from anywhere.

## What S3 is used for
- Storing backups and logs
- Hosting static websites
- Storing application assets (images, videos)
- Data lakes and analytics

## Core S3 concepts
- **Bucket**: A container for objects (globally unique name)
- **Object**: A file stored in S3
- **Key**: The unique identifier for an object
- **Region**: Buckets are created in a specific AWS region
- **Storage Classes**: Different cost and performance tiers

## Security and access
- Access controlled by IAM policies and bucket policies
- Buckets are private by default
- Public access must be explicitly allowed

## Notes
- S3 is highly durable and scalable
- You pay for storage, requests, and data transfer
- Objects are accessed via HTTP/HTTPS
