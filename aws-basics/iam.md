# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM is the service that controls **who** can access AWS and **what** they
are allowed to do.

## Key concepts
- **Users**: Individual people or services
- **Groups**: Collections of users
- **Roles**: Permissions assumed by services or users
- **Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions

## Why IAM matters
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Enables least-privilege security
- Required for almost every AWS service

## Notes
- Root user should not be used for daily tasks
- Permissions should be as minimal as possible
